# Dashboard Api

## Overview

This is a basic Node.js API project built using the Express.js framework. It serves as a starting point for creating a simple web API. The project is configured to listen on port 8080 and is equipped with middleware for handling JSON data and enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). The actual API routes and logic are defined in a separate module, which is included via the "route" file.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Node.js installed.
3. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the server.

## Installation and Usage
